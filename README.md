# Project 1: Your first neural network
Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

A Neural Network for predicting the number of bikeshare users on a given day using only Python.

Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. 

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! 
By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation,


The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

Python 3 libraries used: 
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org)
